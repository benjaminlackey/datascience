# Regression Tutorial

I made this tutorial on regression techniques using scikit-learn for a workshop on Reduced Order Gravitational-Wave Modeling held in June 2018. It covers linear models (Ridge, Lasso), kernel techniques (Kernel Ridge, Support Vector Regression, Gaussian Process Regression), Neural Networks, and tree-based fitting (Random Forest). The goal is to use regularization techniques and hyperparameter optimization to avoid overfitting.
